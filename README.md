# Soil-erosion-segmentation
This repository provides a foundational implementation for detecting soil erosion and deposition traces in high-resolution aerial imagery. Developed as part of our study, "Erosion-SAM: Semantic Segmentation of Soil Erosion by Water" (CATENA, 2025), this code fine-tunes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) specifically for erosion analysis, introducing Erosion-SAM.
